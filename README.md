## Introduction
In this project, I aimed to draw some conclusions from data about movies with highest domestic grosses (Top100) in 2018. I wanted to know what kind of features these high grosses movies share and if the good box office performance reflects the movie quality.  

## Dataset
The three sources I chose were the same as I listed in hw3, while there were some small adjustments of the content of each dataset. The movie list and some basic movie information like the studio, total grosses were scraped from BoxOfficeMojo, and more information related to these movies, like genre, popularity were gained through The movie Database API. Then the critic's scores and general audience scores for these movies was scraped from Rotten Tomatoes websites.
                                                                                                        
## Research Questions
These are four specific questions I came up with and tried to answer with my data:
a. Which studio has the highest box office and which produced the most movies?
b. What's the movie with the lowest average score? Why do you think it still had high box office?
c. Does high popularity reflect the high box office performance?
d. Do tomato critics and audience prefer different movie genres?

## Conclusions
By analyzing my data, I had answers and conclusions for all of them:
a. As of May 5th, BV(the Walt Disney Studios)  is the most profitable studio with $1,155,791,000 box office and 3 movies; Fathom is the most productive studio with 9 movies released and $11,033,841 box office ")
b. My assumption for the answer of Q2 was Fifty Shades Freed, while the analyzing result showed Truth or Dare had the lowest average score 17% with 15% Tomatometer and 19% audience score. The reason it still had good box office performance maybe because of the movie cast and genre are attractive for audiences.
c. My assumption for Q3 was high popularity can reflect the high box office. And the analyzing result supported my assumption. There is a correlation between high popularity and high box office, which means the movie’s high popularity can reflect its high box office.
d. My assumption was critics and general audience would prefer different genres, but I couldn’t identify the specific genre. The analyzing results proved my assumption, and it discovered that critics would prefer Documentary/Horror/Thriller/History/Music movies, and general audience would prefer Crime movies.

## Challenges                                                                        
The first challenge I encountered was my first idea of the project where I wanted to scrape data from a trailer website with a ‘load more’ button. I tried different ways to solve it but still didn’t work. Then I had to change my project to top grosses movies.
The next difficulty appeared when many APIs that I wanted to use for my project were not allowed to get access to unless I paid for them or had a commercial application. Eventually, I managed to gain data I needed from limited sources, but some of the data like the tomato meters can be obtained much easier if I could use its API.
Another one was I didn’t realize some data format was not suitable for analyzing until I started doing data analysis, which means I had to go back and adjusted data format. It’s better to say I’m not experienced enough to predict this problem in prior working.                        
                                                                        
## How to expand my project
5. To expand my project, I want to add the dataset of movie budgets and global grosses. With these new datasets and original dataset, I can figure out the profit of each movie or studio. Maybe there will be some different findings since high box office doesn’t equal to high profit.
In addition, I will present the outcome by utilizing data visualization skills.
